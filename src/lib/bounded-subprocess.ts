/**
 * How long to wait for a killed child to actually be reaped before abandoning it.
 *
 * `kill()` only REQUESTS termination. It returns before the kernel has torn the process down, and
 * every handle that process holds stays held until it does. On Windows that is not a detail: file
 * locking is mandatory, so a directory an abandoned `icacls.exe` still has open cannot be removed
 * by anyone, and the removal fails with EPERM rather than waiting.

/**
 * Wait for a child, bounded. At the deadline, kill it AND wait for it to actually die.
 *
 * This used to kill, `unref`, and resolve in the same tick, which made every caller's "I waited
 * for my child" guarantee false precisely when it mattered. `flushConfigDirHardening` exists so
 * shutdown owns every `icacls.exe` it started; it awaited a promise that had already settled while
 * the child was still alive, so the contract read as satisfied and the directory stayed locked.
 *
 * That cost three failed fixes. #4789 blamed the removal retry budget and asked for more than
 * 2.5s; #4796 gave it a 15s exponential schedule; a later change awaited the hardening flight from
 * the test hook. Windows shard 1/6 failed identically through all three, because none of them
 * addressed a live process holding the handle -- run 35108652486 burned the full 15s budget and
 * still threw `EPERM ... rm ocx-management-auth-fDchUb`, with two
 * `ACL hardening timed out (ETIMEDOUT) - transient icacls stall` lines logged beside it.
 *
* The grace is bounded and abandonment is still the fallback, so a genuinely unkillable child
* cannot hang shutdown. The classification does not move: a child that missed its deadline is
* reported as timed out whether or not it dies during the grace, because it did time out. Only the
* moment of resolution changes.
 *
 * Pass `0` to opt out. The grace buys exactly one thing -- a handle released before somebody
 * removes the path holding it -- so a caller whose child holds nothing anyone deletes should not
 * pay for it. `windows-user-principal` is that caller: its PowerShell lookup sits on the startup
 * critical path, where seconds are the scarce resource and no directory is waiting on the reap.
