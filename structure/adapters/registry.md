# Adapter Registry Authority

## Decision

Runtime adapter construction has one authority: `src/adapters/registry.ts`.

`src/server/adapter-resolve.ts` may resolve a provider/model onto an adapter id, but it does not maintain a second adapter factory inventory. The selected persisted/configured adapter id remains an untrusted string until the registry lookup succeeds. Unknown ids fail with the existing `Unknown adapter: <id>` error instead of widening configuration types around a closed compile-time union.

## Semantic inheritance is not constructor inheritance

Some adapters share another adapter's routed-tool semantics while retaining independent runtime construction:

- `azure` and `azure-openai` inherit the `openai-responses` contract.
  The inherited contract includes Meta Muse's host-gated 64-character tool-name alias when the
  constructed send URL is `api.meta.ai` (`src/responses/muse-tool-name-alias.ts`).
- `mimo-free` inherits the `openai-chat` contract.
- `cursor` stays direct because its `runTurn` transport and gated native-file fallback are distinct.
- `devin` is direct for a related reason. It streams Cognition's
  `ApiServerService/GetChatMessage` over Connect-RPC from `runTurn` with hand-written protobuf
  framing, so like Cursor it never travels the `buildRequest`/`parseStream` path. Both Devin
  provider rows share it. The installed CLI's own `credentials.toml` holds an ordinary
  `devin-session-token`, the same credential `RegisterUser` mints for a browser sign-in, so
  `devin-cli` imports that token and the two rows differ only in where the credential came from.
  `AdapterFactoryContext.providerId` is what keeps them apart: the Cognition tenant is recorded on
  the credential, not in the registry, so the adapter has to know which row it is serving before it
  can resolve a host.

  There is no second Devin transport. An Agent Client Protocol adapter that spawned a local
  `devin acp` child once existed under the `devin-cli` adapter id and was removed: the CLI's
  credential turned out to be the ordinary cloud token, so the child process bought nothing that
  importing the token did not, and it cost a placeholder `buildRequest`, a disabled
  `parseStream`, an identity-only `baseUrl`, and a subprocess running in the operator's tree.
  `projectDevinCliAuthMode` rewrites any saved row that still names the retired adapter id.

The registry records those relationships with `contractParent`. A parent relationship does **not** mean the registry recursively constructs a parent adapter and injects it into the child. Azure and MiMo keep owning their existing internal composition. This avoids making production constructors depend on test/conformance needs and keeps this authority refactor behavior-neutral.

## Wrapper-cycle and runtime validation policy

`effectiveAdapterContract()` follows `contractParent` links at runtime with a visited set. Unknown parents and cycles fail closed. This is intentionally runtime validation: registry/config values can originate in persisted files written by older or hand-edited installations, so compile-time typing alone is not an adequate boundary.

## Extension policy

Adding a production adapter requires:

1. one `ADAPTER_REGISTRY` entry with its factory;
2. either a direct `wire` + mutation contract or an explicit `contractParent`;
3. provider/model adapter ids that point only at registered ids;
4. registry-derived conformance coverage in the follow-up conformance layer.

Do not add a second switch/list of adapter factories in request routing. Focused tests may construct a concrete adapter directly when they are testing that adapter itself; cross-adapter production routing should use registry authority.

## Scope boundary

This decision does not change routed `apply_patch` behavior, Cursor structured-edit conversion, Azure/MiMo request construction, or provider wire selection. Those behaviors remain owned by their existing modules and focused tests. The registry exposes the universe and semantic relationships; the next stack layer consumes that metadata for generic conformance.

## Moonshot `$ref`-with-siblings normalization

Moonshot/Kimi enforce the draft-07 reading where `$ref` must stand alone and 400 the whole
request when a node carries both. Codex's own deferred tool catalog emits exactly that shape,
so the schema is not something a user can fix from configuration (issue #2673).

## Truncated tool finalization

The bridge keeps an open function, custom, or tool-search call incomplete when an adapter ends with a recognized truncated stop reason. Streaming emits no argument/input completion frame for that open call, and buffered JSON applies the same status. A call already closed by its own tool-call end retains its completed state. The response remains incomplete, partial output is preserved, and truncated compaction never replaces history.

A provider web search still in flight at that truncated terminal is finalized as `failed`, the same status it already receives from the error and explicit-incomplete terminals. It never returned results, so reporting it as `completed` would leave the client showing a finished search for a turn the provider cut short.

Chat helper admission in `src/server/responses/core.ts` follows the
[deferred stored-main contract](../providers/openai-tiers.md): only a needed Direct OpenAI helper
claims stored main, after terminal vision, routed vision and search exclusions.

The management quota DTO keeps Combo editing aligned with scoped inference evidence;
see [Combo editor routing quota](../gui-and-management-api.md#combo-editor-routing-quota).

Claude replay carries [Go conversation affinity](../data-planes/inbound-compat.md#claude-affinity-at-final-go-dispatch)
privately to final dispatch; preliminary route selection does not inject Go-only headers.
Native Chat applies qualifying effort ceilings independently of model pins; pin selection precedes the cap and only pins or cap rewrites enter wire mapping. The [catalog effort contract](../catalog.md#ultra-reasoning-level) records the V1/compaction exemptions and caller-preservation boundary.
