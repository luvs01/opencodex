/**
 * `waitForSubprocessExit` must not call a child dead before it is.
 *
 * The helper used to kill at the deadline and resolve in the same tick. Every caller then
 * believed it had waited for its child, which is the guarantee `flushConfigDirHardening` is built
 * on -- shutdown owning every `icacls.exe` it started. On Windows the handle an abandoned child
 * holds keeps a directory unremovable, so the caller proceeded to remove a tree that was still
 * locked and got EPERM. Three separate fixes aimed at the removal retry instead (#4789 raised the
 * budget, #4796 made it exponential over 15s, a later change awaited the hardening flight) and all
 * three failed identically on Windows shard 1/6, because none of them made the child exit.
 *
 * These cases use a fake subprocess rather than a real one on purpose: the contract is about WHEN
 * the promise resolves relative to the child's death, and that is observable without spawning
 * anything, on every platform, deterministically.
