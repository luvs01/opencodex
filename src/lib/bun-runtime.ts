/**
 * Bundled Bun runtime resolution.
 *
 * opencodex ships the Bun runtime via the `bun` npm dependency (esbuild-style:
 * a tiny main package + platform-specific `@oven/bun-*` optionalDependencies,
 * finalized by the package's own postinstall `node install.js`). The npm `bin`
 * launcher (bin/ocx.mjs) and the durable service/shim integrations both need a
 * stable path to that binary. This module is the single source of truth.
 *
 * In a from-source dev checkout the `bun` dependency may be absent; callers fall
 * back to `process.execPath` (which is itself Bun when run via `bun src/cli/index.ts`).
