/**
 * config-write-lock.ts — one advisory lock for every opencodex-originated
 * `config.toml` write.
 *
 * Why a second lock next to the existing two: the injector's SQLite lock N
 * serializes injection against injection, and the prompt-layers lock serializes
 * prompt edits against prompt edits. Neither covers the writers BETWEEN them —
 * the feature scalars in `features.ts`, the `ocx restore`/`removeCodexConfig`
 * transforms, and the journal replay each did their own unlocked read → edit →
 * `atomicWriteFile`. Each write is individually atomic, but a foreign rewrite
 * landing between any writer's read and its rename was silently discarded:
 * a features edit could drop an injection's freshly-written routing keys, a
 * remove could drop a prompt projection committed a millisecond earlier.
 *
 * This lock closes that class at its source rather than per call site: every
 * opencodex writer reads `config.toml` and renames over it while holding
 * `<config>.ocx-write.lock`, so no cooperating writer can be computed against
 * stale bytes and none can land mid-section.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT cover:
 * - Codex itself knows nothing about the file; upstream's own rewrites cannot
 *   be serialized from here. That residual is why the injector's witness and
 *   the drift healer still exist.
 * - Lock ordering: prompt-layers commit() takes the prompt store lock first,
 *   then this one; the injector takes this one first, then N, then C. The one
 *   inversion is the coordinated restore path (N, then this lock inside
 *   `restoreJournalState`/`removeCodexConfig`), and it is safe BECAUSE this
 *   lock never blocks: the second acquire fails instantly, its holder unwinds
 *   N, and the other writer's bounded wait proceeds. No order here can
 *   deadlock.
 * - The injector's held section contains awaits (`withCodexWriteLock` is
 *   async), so the lock must NOT be implicitly reentrant — a same-process
 *   writer that slipped inside on a process-global check would interleave
 *   mid-section. Reentrancy is explicit instead: a caller that already holds
 *   the file passes its handle (`heldConfigWriteLock`) to the writer it
 *   calls.
 * - Acquisition is a single attempt for synchronous writers: the section under
 *   this lock is a handful of file operations, so a busy result means the
 *   caller reports "locked" and the operator retries — the same contract the
 *   prompt store lock already exposes. Async callers (the injector) use the
 *   bounded wait in `acquireConfigWriteLock`.
