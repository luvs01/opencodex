/**
 * The permit is the charge (#4546).
 *
 * `reserveDispatch` used to decide and `permit.use()` used to charge, which made the decision
 * advisory: two legs that read the same remainder in the same turn -- an account move and a
 * rebuild, a combo child and its parent -- both received a permit and both dispatched. One
 * remaining send admitted two physical sends, which is the per-request multiplication the whole
 * budget exists to stop. These pin the three properties the fix depends on: the second racer is
 * refused, an abandoned reservation is refunded exactly, and a send counted by a retry helper is
 * charged once rather than twice.
